# Manna Network Distributed, Co-operative Yellow Pages Style Web Directory
Creates a complete (i.e. with categories and links) web directory on any PHP enabled website. Requires registration at an active Manna Network agent website (visit Manna-Network.com/register for list of available registration sites). The installation of this script enables the site to earn BitcoinSV commissions.


Important: After creating the page where the directory will be displayed it is strongly suggested you add "<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">" to the page's metatags (in the header). This is to prevent the search engines from mistakenly considering each copy as "duplicate content" (which might cause the page or site to be penalized in the rankings).

Installation: Download the script from GitHub (https://github.com/MannaNetwork/php-version) to your local drive.Upload the php directory to your website.

Configure the member_config.php file. You can get the correct settings by logging in to your Advertiser Dashboard (provided to you when you registered as an advertiser). Click the "Settings" Button on the right of your ad listing(s) to get the propers settings. 

That should be it! Visit the php page and you should now have a complete (with categories, links and management) web directory on your site where your visitors can register for advertising across the whole network!
